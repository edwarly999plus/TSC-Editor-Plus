Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edwarly999plus/tsc-editor-plus.git
cd tsc-editor-plus
```

Run the editor:

```bash
python main.py
```

The first run will automatically install required libraries (`ttkbootstrap`, `Pillow`, `pywinstyles`) into a local `libs/` folder.  
If automatic installation fails, you can manually install them with:

```bash
python -m pip install ttkbootstrap==1.10.1
python -m pip install pillow==10.0.0
python -m pip install pywinstyles==1.8
```

# 🧠 Built-In Tools

## 🎨 Syntax Highlighting

TSC commands, IDs, events, and errors are highlighted automatically.

## 📚 Quick Documentation

Browse built-in command documentation directly inside the editor.  
Now with extra info: song names for `<CMU>`, face sprites for `<FAC>`, sound effect names for `<SOU>`.

## 🧹 Smart Replace

Automatically converts problematic characters commonly unsupported by classic TSC encodings.

## 🔍 Manual Encoding Selection

You can now choose the exact encoding and cipher when opening a `.tsc` file, with a live preview.  
This completely solves the "?" character problem for Japanese TSC files.
